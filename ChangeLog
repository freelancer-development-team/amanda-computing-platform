								CHANGELOG
	====================================================================	

This change log includes a (semi) detailed log of all changes produced across
software versions. Please, notice that individual tools keep their own versions,
and the SDK version serves as a 'general' notion of the utilities provided but
it is not specific nor completely reliable.

Preferably, this change log includes a resume of the modifications provided by
Git.
